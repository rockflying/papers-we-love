Papers We Love meet-ups are for anyone interested in Computer Science, Computer Engineering and its history to discuss academic research in a fun, engaging and respectful environment. 

We value the participation of each member of the community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the meet-up and at all Papers We Love events and interactions on the GitHub repository and Meetup site(s).

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, contributors and volunteers are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code of conduct.

The Short Version
-----------------

Papers We Love is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of meet-up participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meet-up, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Papers We Love.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the meet-up at the sole discretion of the organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Contributors to the GitHub repository and the Meetup site, sponsors, or similar are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Organizers (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for Papers We Love.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the meet-up organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meet-up.

Social Rules
------------

In addition to having a code of conduct as an anti-harassment policy, we have a small set of [social rules](https://www.hackerschool.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules) we follow. We (the Papers We Love organizers) learned and lifted these rules from [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/conduct.html), who in turn got them from [Hacker School](https://www.hackerschool.com/), where we felt that they contributed enormously to a supportive, productive, and fun learning environment. We'd like Papers We Love to share that environment. These rules are intended to be lightweight, and to make more explicit certain social norms that are normally implicit. Most of our social rules really boil down to “don't be a jerk“ or “don't be annoying.” Of course, almost nobody sets out to be a jerk or annoying, so telling people not to be jerks isn't a very productive strategy.

Unlike the anti-harassment policy, violation of the social rules will not result in expulsion from the meet up or a strong warning from conference organizers. Rather, they are designed to provide some lightweight social structure for conference attendees to use when interacting with each other.
